## Overview

Conducted a behavioral analysis of smartphone application usage patterns using timestamped app-launch logs from the StudentLife dataset.  

Engineered structured behavioral features from raw event data to model session behavior, total engagement time, and burst activity. The goal was to transform low-level log data into interpretable behavioral metrics suitable for digital well-being analysis and human-computer interaction research.

## Approach

- Cleaned and structured raw timestamp-based smartphone logs  
- Converted UNIX timestamps into datetime objects for temporal analysis  
- Defined sessions using inter-launch interval thresholds  
- Engineered behavioral metrics:
  - Total usage time  
  - Average session duration  
  - Inter-launch interval distribution  
  - Burstiness coefficient  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries and visualizations  
- Compared behavioral patterns across users  

---

## Results

- Identified significant variability in smartphone engagement across users  
- Observed heavy-tailed distributions in inter-launch intervals  
- Detected burst behavior in high-frequency app launch patterns  
- Distinguished between short-burst users and sustained-session users  
- Demonstrated how raw log data can be transformed into interpretable behavioral signals

## Teamwork & Collaboration

This project was completed in a collaborative data science team.

- Divided responsibilities across data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and statistical interpretation  
- Used shared Jupyter notebooks and Git-based version control for reproducibility  
- Held regular coordination meetings to align on modeling decisions and evaluation methods  
- Contributed specifically to session modeling logic and burstiness metric design

## What I Learned

- How to convert raw event logs into structured behavioral features  
- How session definitions impact downstream behavioral metrics  
- Why burstiness captures behavioral intensity better than simple averages  
- How real-world human activity data often follows heavy-tailed distributions  
- How to collaborate effectively on a reproducible analytical workflow
