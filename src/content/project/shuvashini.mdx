## Overview

Implemented and evaluated a collaborative filtering system using latent factor matrix factorization to predict user ratings for video games.

The model was trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset containing 4.6 million ratings across 2.8 million users and 137K items, requiring careful handling of sparsity and generalization.

## Approach

- Implemented SVD-based latent factor decomposition  
- Optimized user and item embeddings using stochastic gradient descent  
- Applied L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting  
- Tuned hyperparameters including embedding dimension, learning rate, and regularization strength  
- Benchmarked against multiple baseline models:
  - Global mean predictor  
  - User bias model  
  - Item bias model  
  - Pearson similarity  
  - Jaccard similarity  
  - Time-decay similarity variants

## Results

The SVD latent factor model achieved:

- **Test MSE: 1.3779**  
- **Global Mean Baseline MSE: 1.6768**  
- ~17–18% reduction in prediction error compared to baseline  

Latent factor modeling consistently outperformed similarity-based and bias-only approaches on both validation and test sets.

## Teamwork & Collaboration

This project was completed in a team of four engineers.

I led the team by organizing task distribution, setting internal milestones, and ensuring alignment with project deadlines. We followed lightweight Agile practices, including:

- Bi-weekly standup meetings to track progress and resolve blockers  
- Iterative development with incremental model improvements  
- Clear division of responsibilities (data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, benchmarking)  
- Shared Git-based workflow for collaboration and version control  

I coordinated model experimentation efforts and aligned the team on evaluation methodology to ensure consistent and fair comparison across all models.
