Before pursuing software engineering, I spent 12 years serving in the United States Navy as a Hospital Corpsman (combat medic). My career spanned both clinical and operational environments, including assignments at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and with the Fleet Marine Force at Naval Air Station New River.

I completed two major deployments, including service with the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit in support of Operation Odyssey Lightning and a humanitarian aid mission to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. These roles required disciplined execution, rapid decision-making under pressure, and the ability to operate effectively in complex, high-stakes environments.

While still on active duty, I earned my Associate of Science degree and began preparing for a transition into technology. I was drawn to computer science because of its structured problem-solving, systems thinking, and the opportunity to build scalable solutions that directly impact users.

I transferred to the University of California, San Diego as a Computer Science major in Earl Warren College. As a non-traditional student, veteran, husband, father of two, and commuter, I balance rigorous technical coursework with significant personal responsibilities. That experience has strengthened my time management, prioritization, and long-term strategic planning skills.

At UC San Diego, I focus on building production-level systems through team-based engineering projects emphasizing clean architecture, performance optimization, and maintainable design. My goal is to leverage both my military leadership background and technical training to contribute meaningfully as a software engineer on high-impact teams.

The transition from military medicine to engineering may appear unconventional, but both fields demand accountability, precision, and systems-level thinking. Those principles continue to guide my work as I move forward in the tech industry.
