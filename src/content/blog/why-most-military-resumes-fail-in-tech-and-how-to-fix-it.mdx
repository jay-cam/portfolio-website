When I first started applying to software engineering roles, my response rate was roughly 1 interview per 200 applications.

After restructuring how I presented my experience, that rate improved to about 1 per 50. 

Same background.  
Same degree.  
Same projects.  

The only thing that changed was positioning.

This is what most military resumes get wrong — and how to fix it.

## **The Real Issue: You're Applying to Be an Engineer**

Tech companies are not hiring “a veteran.”

They’re hiring:

- A backend engineer  
- A frontend developer  
- A systems engineer  

If your resume reads like a performance evaluation instead of an engineering profile, it won’t land.

That doesn’t mean you hide your service.  
It means you frame it correctly.

---

## **Why Military Resumes Struggle in Tech**

### 1. They Sound Like Evaluations

Military evaluations emphasize:

- Leadership
- Responsibility
- Mission execution
- Scope

Engineering resumes emphasize:

- Problems solved
- Systems built
- Technical decisions
- Measurable outcomes

Different language. Different audience.

If a recruiter has to mentally translate your resume, you’ve already made it harder than it needs to be.

---

### 2. They Don’t Align to the Target Role

A very common failure in tech resumes is role misalignment. If you’re applying to backend roles, your resume should scream backend. If it’s frontend, it should scream frontend.

As explained in this <a href="https://www.toptal.com/techresume/career-advice/why-most-tech-resumes-fail-target-role-misalignment" target="_blank">analysis of tech resume misalignment</a>, resumes fail when they don’t clearly reinforce the job they’re targeting.

Your resume is not a museum of everything you’ve ever done.  
It’s a weapon built for one job at a time.

---

### 3. Recruiters Don’t Speak Military

Most tech recruiters:

- Have never served  
- Don’t know what your MOS means  
- Don’t understand evaluation formats  

There’s documented confusion around how military resumes are interpreted in civilian pipelines, including discussion in this <a href="https://www.adecco.com/en-us/employers/resources/article/resume-bias-against-hiring-veterans-and-military-spouses" target="_blank">Adecco article on veteran hiring bias</a>.

That means translation is your job.

Remove acronyms.  
Use civilian language.  
Explain impact in terms engineers understand.

---

### 4. ATS Formatting Quietly Rejects People

Before a human ever sees your resume, software parses it.

Avoid:

- Multi-column layouts  
- Tables  
- Text boxes  
- Graphics  
- Fancy formatting  

Simple, single-column templates are recommended by university career centers (see example guidance <a href="https://careerservices.wvu.edu/resources/resume-templates/" target="_blank">here</a>).

Clean beats clever.

---

## **How to Structure It (If You're a Student Veteran With No Tech Experience Yet)**

If you're in a CS program and don’t have industry tech experience, your resume should reflect that.

Not pretend otherwise.

---

### **1. Short Professional Summary (Only If You’re a Student)**

If you’re transitioning and still in school, you can include a very short summary.

2–3 lines max.

Mention:

- Military background (briefly)
- Current degree
- Target role (internship / entry-level SWE)

That’s it.

No biography.
No motivational speech.

---

### **2. Education (Comes Early for Students)**

If you're applying for internships, education goes near the top.

Include:

- Degree  
- School  
- Graduation date  

Internship recruiters expect you to be a student.

Let it read that way.

---

### **3. Technical Skills (Not a Technology Graveyard)**

This is not where you list every tool you’ve touched once.

If a skill appears here, it must appear in your projects section below.

Group them cleanly:

- Languages  
- Backend  
- Frontend  
- Databases  
- Tools  

If Docker is listed but never used in a project, remove it.

Signal only.

---

### **4. Projects (This Is the Resume)**

For career changers, projects matter more than anything else.

Each project should show:

- What problem it solves  
- What you built  
- What technologies were used  
- Any measurable result  
- Any meaningful design decision  

This is where you demonstrate engineering thinking.

---

## **If You're Applying for Internships — Read This Carefully**

If your goal is internships, your resume should read like a student.

Do not lie.  
Do not inflate.  
Do not list projects written entirely by your favorite LLM.  

And please don’t label yourself “Full Stack Engineer” because you cloned a social media app.

If you have never worked in tech, you truly do not understand what “full stack” means yet.

There are entire PhDs at different layers of the stack.

You made a clone tutorial project and now you’re full stack?

Yeah — no.

You’re a student learning software engineering.

And that’s fine.

Internship recruiters expect that.

---

## **You Need Two Things: A Baseline Resume + Tailored Versions**

You should have:

1. A clean baseline template resume  
2. A tailored version for every role you apply to  

Your technical skills, projects, and even bullet phrasing should match the job description.

If you’re applying to:

- Backend roles → backend-heavy resume  
- Frontend roles → frontend-heavy resume  
- Embedded roles → systems-heavy resume  

Not 10 resumes.  
But definitely not 1 generic one blasted everywhere.

---

## **Military Experience (Translated, Not Spotlighted)**

Treat it like any other job.

Do not:

- Lead with identity  
- Assume context  
- Use internal terminology  

Do:

- Translate leadership into coordination  
- Translate operations into process improvement  
- Show measurable impact  

If it’s not technical, keep it concise.

Your goal is to show professionalism — not overwhelm the page.

---

## **The Bottom Line**

Your resume is not your life story.

It’s a targeted document designed to get one specific job.

If your response rate is low, it’s usually not your experience.

It’s alignment.

You don’t need to hide your service.

You just need to present yourself as what you’re applying to become.

An engineer.
