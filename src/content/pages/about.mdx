  description: |
    I am a Computer Science student and U.S. Navy combat veteran with a strong passion for software engineering, systems, and problem-solving.

    Before returning to school, I served in the military for over a decade
    where I developed discipline, accountability, and the ability to operate in high-stress,
    high-responsibility environments. Those experiences shape how I approach engineering—taking 
    ownership of problems, working well on teams, and following through on commitments.

    I am currently focused on strengthening my computer science fundamentals while
    building hands-on projects through coursework and personal development. I'm currently seeking
    internship or full-time opportunities where I can learn from experienced engineers
    and grow into a dependable software engineer.
